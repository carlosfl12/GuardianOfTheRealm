# GuardianOfTheRealm
In a distant land, a once-thriving kingdom is now facing a dire threat from relentless hordes of goblins determined to invade and lay waste to everything in their path. As chaos looms over the realm, players step into the role of a courageous soldier at the forefront of the kingdom's final line of defense.
